<h2 align="centre">The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
<p align="justify">Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.</p>
<p align="justify">"Pardon, O King!" cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!‚Äù</p>
<p align="justify">The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.</p>
